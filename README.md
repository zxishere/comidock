# Introduction

Deploy lamp(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP5.6) using docker.


### Build and Run

At first, you should have had [Docker](https://docs.docker.com) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) installed.

Without building images one by one, you can make use of `docker-compose` and simply issue:

    $ docker-compose up -d

For more operations to containers, please refer to:

    $ docker-compose --help
